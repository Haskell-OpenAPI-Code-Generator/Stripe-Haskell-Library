-- | Defines the object schema located at @components.schemas.invoice@ in the specification.
-- 
-- Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
-- generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
-- 
-- They contain [invoice items](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
-- that may be caused by subscription upgrades\/downgrades (if necessary).
-- 
-- If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
-- Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
-- that finalizing the invoice,
-- [when automatic](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/invoices\/workflow\/\#auto_advance), does
-- not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
-- until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
-- webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
-- connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
-- creation to finalize the invoice.
-- 
-- If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
-- [email settings](https:\/\/dashboard.stripe.com\/account\/billing\/automatic),
-- Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
-- emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
-- 
-- Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
-- amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
-- charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe\'s [minimum allowed charge
-- per currency](\/docs\/currencies\#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
-- invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
-- customer\'s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
-- 
-- More details on the customer\'s credit balance are
-- [here](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/customer\/balance).
-- 
-- Related guide: [Send Invoices to Customers](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/invoices\/sending).

If the invoice\'s total is smaller than the minimum charge amount, for example, or if there is account credit that can be applied to the invoice, the \`amount_due\` may be 0. If there is a positive \`starting_balance\` for the invoice (the customer owes money), the \`amount_due\` will also take that into account. The charge that gets generated for the invoice will be for the amount specified in \`amount_due\`.

  -- For example, you could use a SetupIntent to set up and save your customer\'s card without immediately collecting a payment.
  -- Later, you can use [PaymentIntents](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#payment_intents) to drive the payment flow.
  -- 
  -- Create a SetupIntent as soon as you\'re ready to collect your customer\'s payment credentials.
  -- Do not maintain long-lived, unconfirmed SetupIntents as they may no longer be valid.
  -- The SetupIntent then transitions through multiple [statuses](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/intents\#intent-statuses) as it guides
  -- you through the setup process.
  -- 
  -- Successful SetupIntents result in payment credentials that are optimized for future payments.
  -- For example, cardholders in [certain regions](\/guides\/strong-customer-authentication) may need to be run through
  -- [Strong Customer Authentication](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/strong-customer-authentication) at the time of payment method collection
  -- in order to streamline later [off-session payments](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/payments\/setup-intents).
  -- If the SetupIntent is used with a [Customer](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#setup_intent_object-customer), upon success,
  -- it will automatically attach the resulting payment method to that Customer.
  -- We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on
  -- PaymentIntents to save payment methods in order to prevent saving invalid or unoptimized payment methods.
  -- 
  -- By using SetupIntents, you ensure that your customers experience the minimum set of required friction,
  -- even as regulations change over time.
