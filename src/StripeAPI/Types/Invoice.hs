-- | Defines the object schema located at @components.schemas.invoice@ in the specification.
--
-- Invoices are statements of amounts owed by a customer, and are either
-- generated one-off, or generated periodically from a subscription.
--
-- They contain [invoice items](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#invoiceitems), and proration adjustments
-- that may be caused by subscription upgrades\/downgrades (if necessary).
--
-- If your invoice is configured to be billed through automatic charges,
-- Stripe automatically finalizes your invoice and attempts payment. Note
-- that finalizing the invoice,
-- [when automatic](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/invoicing\/integration\/automatic-advancement-collection), does
-- not happen immediately as the invoice is created. Stripe waits
-- until one hour after the last webhook was successfully sent (or the last
-- webhook timed out after failing). If you (and the platforms you may have
-- connected to) have no webhooks configured, Stripe waits one hour after
-- creation to finalize the invoice.
--
-- If your invoice is configured to be billed by sending an email, then based on your
-- [email settings](https:\/\/dashboard.stripe.com\/account\/billing\/automatic),
-- Stripe will email the invoice to your customer and await payment. These
-- emails can contain a link to a hosted page to pay the invoice.
--
-- Stripe applies any customer credit on the account before determining the
-- amount due for the invoice (i.e., the amount that will be actually
-- charged). If the amount due for the invoice is less than Stripe\'s [minimum allowed charge
-- per currency](\/docs\/currencies\#minimum-and-maximum-charge-amounts), the
-- invoice is automatically marked paid, and we add the amount due to the
-- customer\'s credit balance which is applied to the next invoice.
--
-- More details on the customer\'s credit balance are
-- [here](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/customer\/balance).
--
-- Related guide: [Send invoices to customers](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/billing\/invoices\/sending)

    -- | amount_due: Final amount due at this time for this invoice. If the invoice\'s total is smaller than the minimum charge amount, for example, or if there is account credit that can be applied to the invoice, the \`amount_due\` may be 0. If there is a positive \`starting_balance\` for the invoice (the customer owes money), the \`amount_due\` will also take that into account. The charge that gets generated for the invoice will be for the amount specified in \`amount_due\`.

    -- | amount_paid: The amount, in cents (or local equivalent), that was paid.

    -- If you use the SetupIntent with a [Customer](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#setup_intent_object-customer),

    -- We recommend using SetupIntents or [setup_future_usage](https:\/\/stripe.com\/docs\/api\#payment_intent_object-setup_future_usage) on

If the verification failed for any reason, such as microdeposit failure, the status will be \`verification_failed\`.

Other validations aren\'t run against external accounts because they\'re only used for payouts. This means the other statuses don\'t apply.
